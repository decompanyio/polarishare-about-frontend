					Although the POLARIS SHARE project currently provides only knowledge
					transaction services as proposed services, it aims to become the
					platform that provides expert network oriented and distributed work
					environments beyond the knowledge transaction
					<br />
					<br />
					Initially, we have a plan to expand to collaborative services such as
					profile, human network services, project management services, business
					messengers and video chat, starting from knowledge exchanges and a
					partner App, Office software.
					<br />
					<br />
					The Open API of The POLARIS SHARE will enable projects to expand
					service platforms by providing API, thereby these services can be
					executed on the common basis which is stored in blockchain.

			Although the project is provided as a hybrid type, it will be designed in
			the ways that decentralization, independence and reliability Â are
			guaranteed, and the most parts of the project will be implemented on the
			blockchain as the blockchain technology will gradually improve more and
			more in the future. The choice of items to be stored in the blockchain
			will be determined by the data volume, the required processing speed and
			the requested level of reliability.
			<br />
			<br />
			For example, the data related to documents can be divided into the
			document itself, the meta-data of documents, and the activity data of
			documents such as the numbers of comments and views. The document itself
			is difficult to record on the current blockchain due to its large size,
			but verification of whether the document is original becomes an important
			issue later, considering document copyright issues. Thus, the system is
			constructed in reliable ways that allows the creation time and
			identification of the originals by that data itself is stored in
			off-chains and hash values are stored in on-chains.
			<br />
			<br />
			Also, although built through the cloud, collaborative tools, including
			Polaris Office as well as various Office software, will be connected and
			used through open APIs. The frontend is implemented through this and
			POLARIS SHARE team can look over data at the same level.
